Hello!

The main objective of this site is to host documentation about a few of the eky projects that have driven my development as a mechanical engineer, both in school and in the workforce.

I also plan to update future projects on here- especially for Senior Design, the goal is to have a continuous, well-documented timeline of the team's project as we make progress over time.
